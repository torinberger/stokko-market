# Stokko Market Whitepaper
## General Idea
It's a stock market game in which players can create their own companies. Others can then invest in those companies. Each company will have to market themselves so investors will be incentivised to purchase stock of that company.
## Development
A simple reflection of real life stock markets will be implemented prior to actual player based companies. In this versions players will be able to buy and sell stock of real life companies virtually with their virtual balance.
## Fun
 - Players will be able to unlock certain achievements as goals.
 - They would be able to create investment firms to invest as a group.
 - Tournaments and a leaderboard for both firms and individuals would also give a sense of competition.
 - Mergers, where player owned companies merge together.
